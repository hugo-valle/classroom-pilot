- Manual configuration management
- Shell-based workflow orchestration

## Migration Guide

### From 2.x to 3.x

The major change in version 3.x is the migration from bash scripts to a Python CLI:

**Old (2.x):**
```bash
./scripts/setup-assignment.sh
./scripts/fetch-student-repos.sh
```

**New (3.x):**
```bash
classroom-pilot assignments setup
classroom-pilot repos fetch
```

### Configuration Changes

Configuration files maintain backward compatibility, but new features use the updated format:

```yaml
# Modern configuration structure
classroom:
  url: "https://classroom.github.com/classrooms/12345"
  assignment_prefix: "assignment-"

github:
  token: "${GITHUB_TOKEN}"
  organization: "my-org"

automation:
  schedule: "0 */6 * * *"
  dry_run: false
```

### Command Mapping

| Legacy Script | New CLI Command |
|---------------|-----------------|
| `setup-assignment.sh` | `classroom-pilot assignments setup` |
| `fetch-student-repos.sh` | `classroom-pilot repos fetch` |
| `assignment-orchestrator.sh` | `classroom-pilot assignments orchestrate` |
| `add-secrets-to-students.sh` | `classroom-pilot secrets add` |
| `cycle-collaborator.sh` | `classroom-pilot repos collaborator cycle` |
| `manage-cron.sh` | `classroom-pilot automation schedule` |
