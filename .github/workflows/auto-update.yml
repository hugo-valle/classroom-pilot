# Schedules weekly maintenance checks to keep the project’s automation up to date.
#
# The `auto-update` workflow runs every Sunday at 02:00 UTC (or manually) to report
# on dependency/tooling updates and to run a lightweight repository health audit.
# Both jobs are placeholders that surface information for maintainers without
# committing changes or opening pull requests yet—useful groundwork for future
# automated updates.
