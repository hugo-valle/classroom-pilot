## 🌿 Emergency Branch Creation Instructions

**For critical hotfix (authorized personnel only):**

1. **Sync with production code:**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. **Create hotfix branch:**
   ```bash
   # Use format: hotfix/issue-number-critical-fix-name
   git checkout -b hotfix/123-fix-critical-issue
   
   # Examples:
   git checkout -b hotfix/456-fix-security-vulnerability
   git checkout -b hotfix/789-resolve-production-crash
   git checkout -b hotfix/101-patch-data-corruption
   ```

3. **Push branch immediately:**
   ```bash
   git push -u origin hotfix/123-fix-critical-issue
   ```

**Emergency Branch Rules:**
- Must start with `hotfix/`
- Include issue number: `hotfix/123-descriptive-name`
- Branch from `main` (not develop)
- Use lowercase with hyphens (kebab-case)
- Be descriptive of critical issue
- Follow pattern: `hotfix/issue-number-fix-critical-problem`

⚠️ **Note:** Hotfixes bypass normal development flow and go directly to production
