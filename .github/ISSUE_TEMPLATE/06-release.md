## 🌿 Release Branch Creation Instructions

**For release preparation (release managers only):**

1. **Sync with development code:**
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull origin develop
   ```

2. **Create release branch:**
   ```bash
   # Use format: release/issue-number-version-number
   git checkout -b release/123-vX.Y.Z
   
   # Examples:
   git checkout -b release/456-v3.1.0
   git checkout -b release/789-v3.0.2
   git checkout -b release/101-v4.0.0-alpha.1
   ```

3. **Push release branch:**
   ```bash
   git push -u origin release/v3.0.1
   ```

**Release Branch Rules:**
- Must start with `release/`
- Include issue number: `release/123-vX.Y.Z`
- Branch from `develop` (not main)
- Use semantic version format: `release/issue-number-vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`
- Include pre-release tags if applicable: `release/456-vX.Y.Z-alpha.1`
- Follow pattern: `release/issue-number-v{version}`

📋 **Release Flow:**
1. Branch from `develop`
2. Finalize version and documentation
3. Merge to `main` via PR
4. Tag release on `main`
5. Merge back to `develop`
