## 🌿 Branch Creation Instructions

**When you're ready to work on this maintenance task:**

1. **Sync with latest code:**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. **Create maintenance branch:**
   ```bash
   # Use format: chore/issue-number-descriptive-name
   git checkout -b chore/123-maintenance-task-name
   
   # Examples:
   git checkout -b chore/456-update-dependencies
   git checkout -b chore/789-refactor-error-handling
   git checkout -b chore/101-improve-build-process
   ```

3. **Push branch to your fork:**
   ```bash
   git push -u origin chore/123-maintenance-task-name
   ```

**Branch Naming Rules:**
- Must start with `chore/`
- Include issue number: `chore/123-descriptive-name`
- Use lowercase with hyphens (kebab-case)
- Be descriptive of maintenance work
- Follow pattern: `chore/issue-number-what-is-being-maintained`
