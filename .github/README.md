- **✅ Enhanced Security**: Eliminates secret exposure risks
- **⚡ Better Performance**: Direct authentication without token lookups

**Setup Required**: Configure trusted publishing on [PyPI project settings](https://pypi.org/manage/project/classroom-pilot/settings/publishing/).

### Required Secrets

| Secret | Purpose | Required For | Status |
|--------|---------|--------------|--------|
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | GitHub API access (auto-provided) | All workflows | ✅ Auto |
| `GH_PAT` | Enhanced permissions for protection | Branch protection | ✅ Required |
| ~~`PYPI_API_TOKEN`~~ | ~~PyPI publishing~~ | ~~Publish workflow~~ | 🔒 **Replaced by OIDC** |

### Modern Infrastructure Updates

## 🛠️ Workflow Infrastructure

### Workflow Utilities (`workflow_utils.sh`)

Our workflows now use centralized utilities for consistent logging and error handling:

**File**: [`.github/scripts/workflow_utils.sh`](.github/scripts/workflow_utils.sh)

#### Logging Functions

```bash
# Standardized logging with timestamps and formatting
log_info "Processing step..."       # Blue info messages
log_success "✅ Step completed!"    # Green success messages  
log_warning "⚠️ Non-critical issue" # Yellow warnings
log_error "❌ Critical failure"     # Red error messages
```

#### Retry Mechanisms

```bash
# Smart retry with exponential backoff
retry_with_backoff "command_to_retry" "description" max_attempts

# Example usage in workflows
retry_with_backoff "poetry install" "dependency installation" 3
retry_with_backoff "pip index versions package" "PyPI verification" 5
```

#### Features

- **Consistent formatting**: All workflows use unified message styling
- **Automatic timestamps**: Every message includes execution time
- **Smart retries**: Exponential backoff for transient failures
- **Error aggregation**: Centralized error handling patterns
- **Safe sourcing**: No global strict mode conflicts

- ✅ Verify branch was actually merged to main (not just pushed)
- ✅ Check `GITHUB_TOKEN` has sufficient permissions
- ✅ Review workflow logs in Actions tab

#### Branch name check failing

- ✅ Use approved prefixes: `feature/`, `bugfix/`, `hotfix/`, `release/`, `docs/`, `chore/`
- ✅ Use lowercase with hyphens: `feature/my-feature`
- ✅ Avoid underscores or mixed case

#### CI tests failing

- ✅ Run ShellCheck locally: `shellcheck scripts/*.sh`
- ✅ Test scripts in different shells (bash, zsh)
- ✅ Check file permissions and executable bits
- ✅ Verify script paths are correct

#### Integration tests failing

- ✅ Check GitHub API authentication and token permissions
- ✅ Verify configuration file format and required fields
- ✅ Review rate limiting and API usage patterns
- ✅ Check cross-platform compatibility issues

#### Python wrapper tests failing

- ✅ Ensure Python environment is properly configured
- ✅ Check package dependencies and version compatibility
- ✅ Verify CLI command syntax and option handling
- ✅ Review Python import paths and module structure

#### Official release workflow failing

- ✅ Ensure tag follows semantic versioning: `v1.2.3`
- ✅ Check that all CI checks pass before tagging
- ✅ Verify repository permissions and secrets
- ✅ Review workflow logs for specific error details

#### Branch protection setup issues

- ✅ Ensure `GH_PAT` secret is configured with admin permissions

## 📝 Best Practices

### When Contributing

1. **Follow branch naming conventions** (enforced by branch-name-check.yml)
2. **Ensure all CI checks pass** before requesting review
3. **Use appropriate release strategy**:
   - Feature branches → Auto-release for development iterations
   - Git tags → Official release for production deployments
4. **Review workflow changes carefully** as they affect the entire team
5. **Test locally first**: Run `poetry run pytest` and linting before pushing
