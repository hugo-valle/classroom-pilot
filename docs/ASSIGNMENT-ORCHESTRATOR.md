# Assignment Orchestrator - Master Workflow Automation

The Assignment Orchestrator is a comprehensive wrapper script that connects all the individual automation tools into a single, streamlined workflow for managing GitHub Classroom assignments.

## üéØ Overview

Instead of running multiple scripts manually, the orchestrator reads a configuration file and executes all necessary steps automatically:

1. **Template Synchronization** - Updates GitHub Classroom with latest template changes
2. **Repository Discovery** - Finds all student repositories from the classroom
3. **Secret Management** - Adds/updates secrets across all student repositories
4. **Student Assistance** - Optionally runs student help tools
5. **Collaborator Cycling** - Fixes student repository access issues by cycling permissions

## üìÅ Files

- **`scripts/assignment-orchestrator.sh`** - Main orchestration script
- **`assignment.conf`** - Configuration file with all assignment settings

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Configure Your Assignment
Edit `assignment.conf` with your assignment details:

```bash
# GitHub Classroom assignment URL
CLASSROOM_URL="https://classroom.github.com/classrooms/YOUR-CLASSROOM/assignments/YOUR-ASSIGNMENT"

# Template repository URL  
TEMPLATE_REPO_URL="https://github.com/YOUR-ORG/YOUR-TEMPLATE.git"

# Secrets to manage
SECRETS=(
    "INSTRUCTOR_TESTS_TOKEN:instructor_token.txt:Token for accessing instructor tests"
    "GRADING_TOKEN:grading_token.txt:Token for automated grading"
)
```

### 2. Run the Complete Workflow
```bash
# Full workflow with confirmation
./scripts/assignment-orchestrator.sh

# Automated workflow (no prompts)
./scripts/assignment-orchestrator.sh --yes

# Preview what would be done
./scripts/assignment-orchestrator.sh --dry-run
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration File Format

The `assignment.conf` file uses shell variable syntax and supports:

### Assignment Information
```bash
CLASSROOM_URL="https://classroom.github.com/..."
TEMPLATE_REPO_URL="https://github.com/..."
GITHUB_ORGANIZATION="WSU-ML-DL"
```

### Secret Management
```bash
SECRETS=(
    "SECRET_NAME:token_file.txt:Description"
    "ANOTHER_SECRET:another_token.txt:Another description"
)
SECRET_MAX_AGE_DAYS=90
SECRET_FORCE_UPDATE=false
```

### Workflow Control
```bash
STEP_SYNC_TEMPLATE=true
STEP_DISCOVER_REPOS=true  
STEP_MANAGE_SECRETS=true
STEP_ASSIST_STUDENTS=false
STEP_CYCLE_COLLABORATORS=false
```

### Output Settings
```bash
OUTPUT_DIR="scripts"
STUDENT_REPOS_FILE="student-repos-batch.txt"
DRY_RUN=false
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Command Line Options

### Basic Usage
```bash
# Use default configuration
./scripts/assignment-orchestrator.sh

# Use custom configuration file
./scripts/assignment-orchestrator.sh my-assignment.conf
```

### Workflow Control
```bash
# Run only specific step
./scripts/assignment-orchestrator.sh --step secrets

# Skip specific step  
./scripts/assignment-orchestrator.sh --skip sync

# Run collaborator cycling step
./scripts/assignment-orchestrator.sh --step cycle

# Preview mode
./scripts/assignment-orchestrator.sh --dry-run
```

### Automation Options

# No confirmation prompts
./scripts/assignment-orchestrator.sh --yes

# Verbose output
./scripts/assignment-orchestrator.sh --verbose

# Combined options
./scripts/assignment-orchestrator.sh --dry-run --verbose
```

## üìã Workflow Steps

### Step 1: Template Synchronization (`sync`)
- Executes `scripts/push-to-classroom.sh`
- Pushes latest template changes to GitHub Classroom
- Ensures all students get updated template content

### Step 2: Repository Discovery (`discover`)
- Executes `scripts/fetch-student-repos.sh`
- Uses classroom URL to find all student repositories
- Generates batch files for subsequent operations
- Creates both complete and students-only repository lists

### Step 3: Secret Management (`secrets`)
- Executes `scripts/add-secrets-to-students.sh` for each configured secret
- Supports multiple secrets with different token files
- Respects age-based update policies
- Can force update all secrets if needed

### Step 4: Student Assistance (`assist`) 
- Executes `scripts/student-update-helper.sh`
- Provides automated assistance for common student issues
- Optional step (disabled by default)

### Step 5: Collaborator Cycling (`cycle`)
- Executes `scripts/cycle-collaborator.sh` with configuration mode
- Fixes repository access issues by cycling collaborator permissions
- Intelligently detects when cycling is needed vs when access is already correct
- Optional step (disabled by default)
- Useful for resolving GitHub Classroom permission glitches

## üéõÔ∏è Advanced Usage

### Multiple Assignments
Create separate configuration files for different assignments:

```bash
# CS6600 Module 1
./scripts/assignment-orchestrator.sh cs6600-m1.conf

# CS6600 Module 2  
./scripts/assignment-orchestrator.sh cs6600-m2.conf

# Final Project
./scripts/assignment-orchestrator.sh final-project.conf
```

### Partial Workflows
Run only specific parts of the workflow:

```bash
# Only sync template (for urgent fixes)
./scripts/assignment-orchestrator.sh --step sync

# Only manage secrets (for token updates)
./scripts/assignment-orchestrator.sh --step secrets

# Only fix repository access issues
./scripts/assignment-orchestrator.sh --step cycle

# Everything except student assistance
./scripts/assignment-orchestrator.sh --skip assist
```

### Development and Testing
```bash
# Test configuration without making changes
./scripts/assignment-orchestrator.sh --dry-run

# Debug configuration issues
./scripts/assignment-orchestrator.sh --verbose --dry-run

# Force execution without prompts (for CI/CD)
./scripts/assignment-orchestrator.sh --yes
```

## üîß Integration with Existing Scripts

The orchestrator is designed to work seamlessly with existing scripts:

- **`push-to-classroom.sh`** - Called for template synchronization
- **`fetch-student-repos.sh`** - Called with `--classroom-url` parameter
- **`add-secrets-to-students.sh`** - Called with `--batch` mode for each secret
- **`student-update-helper.sh`** - Called with `--batch` mode for assistance
- **`cycle-collaborator.sh`** - Called with `--config` and `--repo-urls` for access fixes

All scripts maintain their individual functionality and can still be used standalone.

## üìä Output and Logging

### Generated Files
```
scripts/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ student-repos-batch.txt          # All repositories (students + instructor)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ student-repos-students-only.txt  # Only student repositories
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ assignment-workflow.log          # Execution log (if enabled)
```

### Console Output
- **Color-coded messages** for different types of information
- **Progress indicators** for each workflow step
- **Summary statistics** showing repository counts and execution time
- **Error reporting** with specific failure details

### Example Output
```
=== Configuration Summary ===

```

## üö® Error Handling

### Configuration Validation
- **Required variables** are checked before execution
- **File paths** are validated for existence
- **URL formats** are verified for classroom URLs

### Step Failure Handling  
- Each step is independent and can fail without stopping others
- **Failed steps** are reported in the final summary
- **Partial success** scenarios are clearly indicated

### Recovery Procedures
```bash
# Check which step failed
./scripts/assignment-orchestrator.sh --verbose

# Retry specific failed step
./scripts/assignment-orchestrator.sh --step secrets

# Fix configuration and retry
vim assignment.conf
./scripts/assignment-orchestrator.sh
```

## üîí Security Considerations

### Token Management
- **Token files** are never committed to git
- **Configuration** can reference multiple token files
- **Age-based updates** prevent using expired tokens

### Dry Run Safety
- **Preview mode** shows all actions without executing
- **Configuration validation** happens before any operations
- **User confirmation** required by default (can be disabled)

### Access Control
- Inherits **GitHub CLI authentication**
- Respects **repository permissions** from component scripts
- **Validates access** before attempting operations

## üéì Best Practices

### Configuration Management
1. **Version control** configuration files (but not token files)
2. **Document changes** when updating assignment settings
3. **Test with dry-run** before executing on production

### Workflow Execution
1. **Run sync step** after template changes
2. **Monitor output** for any error messages
3. **Verify results** by checking generated repository files

### Maintenance
1. **Update token files** before they expire
2. **Review configuration** at the start of each semester
3. **Test workflows** with new assignments before deploying

---

**Note:** The orchestrator requires all component scripts to be present and executable. It will check for required dependencies and report any missing components before execution.
