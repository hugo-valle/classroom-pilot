## Branching & Versioning Strategy

This project follows a Git Flow-inspired approach for release management:

### Branch Structure
- **`main`**: Production-ready code (tagged releases only)
- **`develop`**: Active development branch
- **`feature/*`**: Feature development branches
- **`release/*`**: Release preparation branches
- **`hotfix/*`**: Emergency fixes

### Versioning
We use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/): `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`
