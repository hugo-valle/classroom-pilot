    TestEdgeCasesAndErrorHandling
    -----------------------------

    This test class contains comprehensive test cases for the `AssignmentSetup` wizard, focusing on edge cases and error handling scenarios. The tests ensure that the setup wizard behaves correctly under various failure conditions, unexpected inputs, and state management requirements. Covered scenarios include:

    - Handling of unexpected exceptions during the wizard workflow, ensuring proper exit codes.
    - Robustness when repository URL parsing fails, including fallback mechanisms for organization and template URLs.
    - Correct handling when assignment name extraction from URLs returns empty values, requiring manual input.
    - Error propagation and handling when file creation or configuration generation fails due to permission or file system errors.
    - Token configuration logic, including cases where empty tokens are provided.
    - Input handling with leading/trailing whitespace and ensuring values are stored as received.
    - State isolation between multiple consecutive wizard runs to prevent cross-contamination.
    - Initialization failures in dependencies such as `PathManager` and `ConfigGenerator`, ensuring exceptions are raised and handled as expected.

    Each test method is designed to simulate a specific edge case or error, using mocks and patches to control dependencies and assert correct behavior.
