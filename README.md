## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration System

### Main Configuration File
The `assignment.conf` file controls all aspects of the workflow:

```bash
# Assignment Information
CLASSROOM_URL="https://classroom.github.com/classrooms/ID/assignments/NAME"
CLASSROOM_REPO_URL="https://github.com/ORG/classroom-semester-assignment"  # Optional: for push-to-classroom.sh
TEMPLATE_REPO_URL="https://github.com/ORG/template.git"
GITHUB_ORGANIZATION="YOUR-ORG"

# Generic Assignment Support (NEW in v1.5)
ASSIGNMENT_FILE="your_assignment_file"    # Universal: .ipynb, .py, .cpp, .sql, .md, etc.

# Legacy support (deprecated - use ASSIGNMENT_FILE instead)
# ASSIGNMENT_NOTEBOOK="your_assignment.ipynb"  # Jupyter notebooks only

# Secret Management
SECRETS=(
    "INSTRUCTOR_TESTS_TOKEN:instructor_token.txt:Description"
    "GRADING_TOKEN:grading_token.txt:Another description"
)

# Workflow Control
STEP_SYNC_TEMPLATE=true
STEP_DISCOVER_REPOS=true
STEP_MANAGE_SECRETS=true
STEP_ASSIST_STUDENTS=false

# Output Settings
OUTPUT_DIR="tools/generated"
```

### Example Configurations
- `assignment-example.conf` - Ready-to-use template
- Safe defaults for testing and development
- Commented examples for all features

## üîÑ Workflow Integration

### Typical Assignment Lifecycle

```bash
# 1. Initial setup
git submodule add https://github.com/hugo-valle/gh_classroom_tools.git tools
cp tools/assignment-example.conf assignment.conf

# 2. Create assignment in GitHub Classroom
# Get the classroom URL from GitHub Classroom interface

# 3. Configure for your specific assignment (NEW in v1.4)
vim assignment.conf  # Set ASSIGNMENT_NOTEBOOK="your_assignment.ipynb"

# 4. Run automation with enhanced generic support
./tools/scripts/assignment-orchestrator.sh assignment.conf --dry-run  # Preview
./tools/scripts/assignment-orchestrator.sh assignment.conf  # Execute

# 5. Ongoing maintenance
./tools/scripts/assignment-orchestrator.sh assignment.conf --step secrets  # Update secrets
./tools/scripts/assignment-orchestrator.sh assignment.conf --step assist   # Help students
```

### Integration with Assignment Repositories

```bash
# Assignment repository structure with submodule (v1.4 Enhanced)
your-assignment/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tools/                    # <- GitHub Classroom Tools (submodule)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ assignment.conf           # <- Your assignment configuration with ASSIGNMENT_NOTEBOOK
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ instructor_token.txt      # <- Your GitHub token (git-ignored)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ your_assignment.ipynb     # <- Assignment notebook (configurable name)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt          # <- Assignment dependencies
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore               # <- Includes tools/generated/ pattern
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tools/generated/         # <- Auto-generated files (git-ignored)
```

### New in v1.4: Universal Assignment Support

The tools now automatically detect assignment files through the `ASSIGNMENT_FILE` configuration variable, making the same toolset work across different assignments and file types without modification:

```bash
# Different assignments, different file types, same tools
hw1/assignment.conf:  ASSIGNMENT_FILE="python_basics.py"
hw2/assignment.conf:  ASSIGNMENT_FILE="database_queries.sql"  
hw3/assignment.conf:  ASSIGNMENT_FILE="data_analysis.ipynb"
hw4/assignment.conf:  ASSIGNMENT_FILE="web_project.html"
final/assignment.conf: ASSIGNMENT_FILE="capstone_project.cpp"
```

## üîí Security and Best Practices

### Token Management
- **Store tokens in separate files** (not in configuration)
- **Use .gitignore** to prevent token commits
- **Rotate tokens regularly** using age-based policies
- **Validate token permissions** before operations

### Repository Access
- **Verify GitHub CLI authentication** before use
- **Check organization permissions** automatically
- **Handle access denied scenarios** gracefully
- **Provide clear error messages** for permission issues
- **Enhanced submodule context detection** for proper repository root identification

### Safe Operations
- **Dry-run mode** for testing configurations
- **User confirmation** before destructive operations
- **Partial failure handling** with detailed reporting
- **Backup and rollback** capabilities where applicable
- **Generic assignment validation** through configurable notebook detection

## ÔøΩ Running Scripts Directly

All scripts now automatically load settings from `assignment.conf`, making direct execution seamless. Here are practical examples for common instructor tasks:

### Complete Assignment Setup Workflow

```bash
# 1. Discover all student repositories
./tools/scripts/fetch-student-repos.sh --exclude-instructor

# 2. Add secrets to all students  
./tools/scripts/add-secrets-to-students.sh INSTRUCTOR_TESTS_TOKEN --batch tools/generated/student-repos-students-only.txt

# 3. Push template updates to classroom
./tools/scripts/push-to-classroom.sh

# 4. Help students who need updates
./tools/scripts/student-update-helper.sh --batch tools/generated/student-repos-students-only.txt --dry-run
```

### Individual Script Examples

```bash
# Repository Discovery with GitHub Classroom URL
./tools/scripts/fetch-student-repos.sh \
  --classroom-url https://classroom.github.com/classrooms/206604610-wsu-ml-dl-classroom-fall25/assignments/cs6600-m1-homework1 \
  --exclude-instructor \
  --output current-students.txt

# Secret Management with Custom Settings
./tools/scripts/add-secrets-to-students.sh GRADING_TOKEN \
  --token-file grading_token.txt \
  --max-age 30 \
  --batch current-students.txt

# Student Assistance for Specific Issues
./tools/scripts/student-update-helper.sh \
  https://github.com/WSU-ML-DL/cs6600-m1-homework1-student123 \
  --dry-run

# NEW: Single student help using template directly (bypasses classroom repo issues)
./tools/scripts/student-update-helper.sh --one-student \
  https://github.com/WSU-ML-DL/cs6600-m1-homework1-student123

# Template Sync with Environment Override (for testing)
ASSIGNMENT_NOTEBOOK="test_notebook.ipynb" ./tools/scripts/push-to-classroom.sh --force
```

### Batch Processing Workflows

```bash
# Generate different student lists for different purposes
./tools/scripts/fetch-student-repos.sh --exclude-instructor --output students-only.txt
./tools/scripts/fetch-student-repos.sh --include-template --output all-repos.txt

# Process different student groups
./tools/scripts/add-secrets-to-students.sh INSTRUCTOR_TESTS_TOKEN --batch students-only.txt
./tools/scripts/student-update-helper.sh --batch students-only.txt --dry-run

# Status checking across all students
while read repo; do
  echo "Checking: $repo"
  ./tools/scripts/student-update-helper.sh --status "$repo"
done < students-only.txt
```

### Troubleshooting and Validation

```bash
# Verify your token permissions
./tools/scripts/add-secrets-to-students.sh --check-token

# Test repository discovery without writing files
./tools/scripts/fetch-student-repos.sh --dry-run

# Check individual student status
./tools/scripts/student-update-helper.sh --status https://github.com/WSU-ML-DL/cs6600-m1-homework1-student123

# Validate classroom repository state
./tools/scripts/student-update-helper.sh --check-classroom
```

### Environment Variable Overrides

When you need to test or run scripts with different settings without modifying `assignment.conf`:

```bash
# Test with different assignment notebook
ASSIGNMENT_NOTEBOOK="test.ipynb" ./tools/scripts/fetch-student-repos.sh --dry-run

# Override GitHub organization for testing
GITHUB_ORGANIZATION="TEST-ORG" ./tools/scripts/fetch-student-repos.sh --dry-run

# Use different classroom URL temporarily
CLASSROOM_URL="https://classroom.github.com/test" ./tools/scripts/fetch-student-repos.sh --dry-run
```

### Quick Reference: Most Common Commands

```bash
# Daily instructor workflow
./tools/scripts/fetch-student-repos.sh --exclude-instructor  # Get current student list
./tools/scripts/push-to-classroom.sh                         # Sync any template changes
./tools/scripts/student-update-helper.sh --batch tools/generated/student-repos-students-only.txt --dry-run  # Check who needs help

# Weekly maintenance  
./tools/scripts/add-secrets-to-students.sh INSTRUCTOR_TESTS_TOKEN --batch tools/generated/student-repos-students-only.txt --max-age 7  # Refresh old secrets

# Individual student help (when classroom repo has issues)
./tools/scripts/student-update-helper.sh --one-student https://github.com/ORG/student-repo  # Direct template-to-student update
```

**üí° Pro Tips:**
- Always use `--dry-run` first to preview changes
- Use `--one-student` when classroom repository URL issues occur
- Generated batch files are saved in `tools/generated/` and automatically git-ignored
- Scripts automatically detect submodule context and load `assignment.conf`
- Use `--help` on any script to see all available options
- Environment variables override `assignment.conf` settings for testing
