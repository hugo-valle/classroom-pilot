## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Add as Submodule to Your Assignment Repository

```bash
# In your assignment repository root
git submodule add https://github.com/hugo-valle/gh_classroom_tools.git tools
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### 2. Configure Your Assignment

```bash
# Copy and customize the configuration template
cp tools/assignment-example.conf assignment.conf
vim assignment.conf

# Set your assignment file (supports any file type!)
# Examples:
# ASSIGNMENT_FILE="homework.py"        # Python assignment
# ASSIGNMENT_FILE="assignment.cpp"     # C++ assignment  
# ASSIGNMENT_FILE="queries.sql"        # SQL assignment
# ASSIGNMENT_FILE="notebook.ipynb"     # Jupyter notebook
```

### 3. Run the Complete Workflow

```bash
# Execute the full automation workflow
./tools/scripts/assignment-orchestrator.sh assignment.conf
```

### 4. Optional: Set Up Automated Cron Sync

For hands-off assignment management, install the automated cron job:

```bash
# Install 4-hour automated sync
./tools/scripts/manage-cron.sh install

# Monitor sync activity
./tools/scripts/manage-cron.sh logs

# Check status
./tools/scripts/manage-cron.sh status
```

The cron job will automatically:
- Sync template changes with GitHub Classroom every 4 hours
- Push tokens to student repositories as they accept assignments
- Log all activity for monitoring

See [Cron Automation Documentation](docs/CRON-AUTOMATION.md) for detailed setup and configuration.

## ÔøΩ Adding Tools to Your Assignment Repository

### Step-by-Step Submodule Setup

To use these GitHub Classroom automation tools in your assignment repository, you need to add them as a git submodule. **The submodule folder must be named `tools`** for the scripts to work correctly.

#### 1. Navigate to Your Assignment Repository

```bash
# Go to your assignment repository root directory
cd /path/to/your-assignment-repository

# Verify you're in the right place (should see your assignment files)
ls -la
# You should see files like: assignment.ipynb, README.md, requirements.txt, etc.
```

#### 2. Add the Tools Submodule

```bash
# Add the tools repository as a submodule named 'tools'
git submodule add https://github.com/hugo-valle/gh_classroom_tools.git tools

# Initialize and update the submodule
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: The submodule **must** be named `tools` because:
- All scripts expect to find themselves at `./tools/scripts/`
- Configuration files are loaded relative to the `tools/` directory
- The orchestrator automatically detects the repository root as the parent of `tools/`

#### 3. Verify the Setup

```bash
# Check that the submodule was added correctly
git status
# Should show: new file: .gitmodules and new file: tools

# Verify the tools are accessible
ls tools/scripts/
# Should show: assignment-orchestrator.sh, fetch-student-repos.sh, cycle-collaborator.sh, etc.

# Test the submodule setup
./tools/scripts/assignment-orchestrator.sh --help
# Should display the help message
```

#### 4. Commit the Submodule Addition

```bash
# Add and commit the submodule to your repository
git add .gitmodules tools
git commit -m "Add GitHub Classroom automation tools as submodule

- Added hugo-valle/gh_classroom_tools as tools/ submodule
- Provides complete workflow automation for GitHub Classroom
- Includes orchestrator, repository discovery, and secret management"

# Push to your repository
git push origin main
```

#### 5. Create Your Configuration

```bash
# Copy the example configuration and customize it for your assignment
cp tools/assignment-example.conf assignment.conf

# Edit the configuration for your specific assignment
vim assignment.conf  # or your preferred editor

# Key settings to configure:
# - CLASSROOM_URL: Your GitHub Classroom assignment URL
# - ASSIGNMENT_FILE: Your main assignment file (any type: .py, .cpp, .sql, .ipynb, etc.)
# - GITHUB_ORGANIZATION: Your GitHub organization name
# - SECRETS: Any secrets you want to add to student repositories
```

### Repository Structure After Setup

After adding the tools submodule, your assignment repository should look like this:

```
your-assignment-repository/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitmodules                    # Git submodule configuration (auto-created)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ assignment.conf                # Your assignment configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ your-assignment-file.*         # Your main assignment file (.py, .cpp, .sql, .ipynb, etc.)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                      # Your assignment README
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt               # Dependencies (if applicable)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tools/                         # ‚Üê GitHub Classroom Tools (submodule)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scripts/                   # Automation scripts
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docs/                      # Documentation
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ assignment-example.conf    # Configuration template
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                  # Tools documentation
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [other assignment files]       # Additional assignment resources
```

### Updating the Tools Submodule

When new features or fixes are added to the tools repository, you can update your submodule:

```bash
# Update to the latest version of the tools
git submodule update --remote tools

# Commit the submodule update
git add tools
git commit -m "Update tools submodule to latest version"
git push origin main
```

### Troubleshooting Submodule Setup

#### Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue**: `./tools/scripts/assignment-orchestrator.sh: No such file or directory`
```bash
# Solution: Initialize the submodule
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

**Issue**: Scripts can't find configuration or repository root
```bash
# Solution: Ensure submodule is named 'tools' (not 'gh_classroom_tools')
git submodule add https://github.com/hugo-valle/gh_classroom_tools.git tools
```

**Issue**: Permission denied when running scripts
```bash
# Solution: Make scripts executable
chmod +x tools/scripts/*.sh
```

**Issue**: Submodule appears empty after cloning
```bash
# Solution: Initialize submodules after cloning
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <your-repo>
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### For Team Repositories

If multiple instructors are working on the same assignment repository:

```bash
# When cloning the repository, always initialize submodules
git clone <assignment-repo-url>
cd <assignment-repo>
git submodule update --init --recursive

# When pulling updates that include submodule changes
git pull origin main
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

```

### URL Configuration Guide

Understanding the difference between GitHub Classroom URLs is crucial for proper configuration:

#### `CLASSROOM_URL` (Required)
- **What it is**: The GitHub Classroom assignment management page URL
- **Used for**: Discovering student repositories, extracting assignment names
- **Format**: `https://classroom.github.com/classrooms/CLASSROOM-ID/assignments/ASSIGNMENT-NAME`
- **How to find**: Go to GitHub Classroom ‚Üí Your Classroom ‚Üí Assignments ‚Üí Click your assignment ‚Üí Copy URL from browser

#### `CLASSROOM_REPO_URL` (Optional)
- **What it is**: The actual git repository URL created by GitHub Classroom for the assignment
- **Used for**: Template synchronization with `push-to-classroom.sh`
- **Format**: `https://github.com/ORG/classroom-semester-assignment-template`
- **How to find**: Look for a repository in your organization with a name like `classroom-fall25-assignment-template`

```bash
# Example distinction:
CLASSROOM_URL="https://classroom.github.com/classrooms/12345/assignments/cs6600-homework1"     # Assignment page
CLASSROOM_REPO_URL="https://github.com/WSU-ML-DL/classroom-fall25-cs6600-homework1-template"  # Repository URL
```

### New in v1.4: Universal Assignment Support

The tools now automatically detect assignment files through the `ASSIGNMENT_FILE` configuration variable, making the same toolset work across different assignments and file types without modification:

```bash
# Different assignments, different file types, same tools
hw1/assignment.conf:  ASSIGNMENT_FILE="python_basics.py"
hw2/assignment.conf:  ASSIGNMENT_FILE="database_queries.sql"  
hw3/assignment.conf:  ASSIGNMENT_FILE="data_analysis.ipynb"
hw4/assignment.conf:  ASSIGNMENT_FILE="web_project.html"
final/assignment.conf: ASSIGNMENT_FILE="capstone_project.cpp"
```

## üîí Security and Best Practices

### Token Management
- **Store tokens in separate files** (not in configuration)
- **Use .gitignore** to prevent token commits
- **Rotate tokens regularly** using age-based policies
- **Validate token permissions** before operations

### Repository Access
- **Verify GitHub CLI authentication** before use
- **Check organization permissions** automatically
- **Handle access denied scenarios** gracefully
- **Provide clear error messages** for permission issues
- **Enhanced submodule context detection** for proper repository root identification

### Safe Operations
- **Dry-run mode** for testing configurations
- **User confirmation** before destructive operations
- **Partial failure handling** with detailed reporting
- **Backup and rollback** capabilities where applicable
- **Generic assignment validation** through configurable notebook detection

## ÔøΩ Running Scripts Directly

All scripts now automatically load settings from `assignment.conf`, making direct execution seamless. Here are practical examples for common instructor tasks:

### Complete Assignment Setup Workflow

```bash
# 1. Discover all student repositories
./tools/scripts/fetch-student-repos.sh --exclude-instructor

# 2. Add secrets to all students  
./tools/scripts/add-secrets-to-students.sh INSTRUCTOR_TESTS_TOKEN --batch tools/generated/student-repos-students-only.txt

# 3. Push template updates to classroom
./tools/scripts/push-to-classroom.sh

# 4. Help students who need updates
./tools/scripts/student-update-helper.sh --batch tools/generated/student-repos-students-only.txt --dry-run
```

### Individual Script Examples

```bash
# Repository Discovery with GitHub Classroom URL
./tools/scripts/fetch-student-repos.sh \
  --classroom-url https://classroom.github.com/classrooms/206604610-wsu-ml-dl-classroom-fall25/assignments/cs6600-m1-homework1 \
  --exclude-instructor \
  --output current-students.txt

# Secret Management with Custom Settings
./tools/scripts/add-secrets-to-students.sh GRADING_TOKEN \
  --token-file grading_token.txt \
  --max-age 30 \
  --batch current-students.txt

# Student Assistance for Specific Issues
./tools/scripts/student-update-helper.sh \
  https://github.com/WSU-ML-DL/cs6600-m1-homework1-student123 \
  --dry-run

# NEW: Single student help using template directly (bypasses classroom repo issues)
./tools/scripts/student-update-helper.sh --one-student \
  https://github.com/WSU-ML-DL/cs6600-m1-homework1-student123

# Template Sync with Environment Override (for testing)
ASSIGNMENT_NOTEBOOK="test_notebook.ipynb" ./tools/scripts/push-to-classroom.sh --force
```

### Batch Processing Workflows

```bash
# Generate different student lists for different purposes
./tools/scripts/fetch-student-repos.sh --exclude-instructor --output students-only.txt
./tools/scripts/fetch-student-repos.sh --include-template --output all-repos.txt

# Process different student groups
./tools/scripts/add-secrets-to-students.sh INSTRUCTOR_TESTS_TOKEN --batch students-only.txt
./tools/scripts/student-update-helper.sh --batch students-only.txt --dry-run

# Status checking across all students
while read repo; do
  echo "Checking: $repo"
  ./tools/scripts/student-update-helper.sh --status "$repo"
done < students-only.txt
```

### Troubleshooting and Validation

```bash
# Verify your token permissions
./tools/scripts/add-secrets-to-students.sh --check-token

# Test repository discovery without writing files
./tools/scripts/fetch-student-repos.sh --dry-run

# Check individual student status
./tools/scripts/student-update-helper.sh --status https://github.com/WSU-ML-DL/cs6600-m1-homework1-student123

# Validate classroom repository state
./tools/scripts/student-update-helper.sh --check-classroom
```

### Environment Variable Overrides

When you need to test or run scripts with different settings without modifying `assignment.conf`:

```bash
# Test with different assignment notebook
ASSIGNMENT_NOTEBOOK="test.ipynb" ./tools/scripts/fetch-student-repos.sh --dry-run

# Override GitHub organization for testing
GITHUB_ORGANIZATION="TEST-ORG" ./tools/scripts/fetch-student-repos.sh --dry-run

# Use different classroom URL temporarily
CLASSROOM_URL="https://classroom.github.com/test" ./tools/scripts/fetch-student-repos.sh --dry-run
```

### Quick Reference: Most Common Commands

```bash
# Daily instructor workflow
./tools/scripts/fetch-student-repos.sh --exclude-instructor  # Get current student list
./tools/scripts/push-to-classroom.sh                         # Sync any template changes
./tools/scripts/student-update-helper.sh --batch tools/generated/student-repos-students-only.txt --dry-run  # Check who needs help

# Weekly maintenance  
./tools/scripts/add-secrets-to-students.sh INSTRUCTOR_TESTS_TOKEN --batch tools/generated/student-repos-students-only.txt --max-age 7  # Refresh old secrets
./tools/scripts/cycle-collaborator.sh --config assignment.conf --batch tools/generated/student-repos-students-only.txt --repo-urls  # Fix any access issues

# Individual student help (when classroom repo has issues)
./tools/scripts/student-update-helper.sh --one-student https://github.com/ORG/student-repo  # Direct template-to-student update
```

**üí° Pro Tips:**
- Always use `--dry-run` first to preview changes
- Use `--one-student` when classroom repository URL issues occur
- Generated batch files are saved in `tools/generated/` and automatically git-ignored
- Scripts automatically detect submodule context and load `assignment.conf`
- Use `--help` on any script to see all available options
- Environment variables override `assignment.conf` settings for testing

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common URL Configuration Issues

#### "CLASSROOM_REPO_URL is not set" Error
```bash
# Error from push-to-classroom.sh
[ERROR] CLASSROOM_REPO_URL is not set in assignment.conf

# Solution: Add the GitHub Classroom repository URL (not the assignment page URL)
CLASSROOM_REPO_URL="https://github.com/ORG/classroom-semester-assignment-template"
```

#### Repository Discovery Issues
```bash
# No repositories found
[WARNING] No repositories found matching pattern: assignment-prefix-*

# Check your CLASSROOM_URL format:
# ‚úÖ Correct: https://classroom.github.com/classrooms/12345/assignments/assignment-name
# ‚ùå Wrong: https://github.com/ORG/repository-name
```

#### Instructor Repository Filtering
```bash
# To exclude instructor repositories from student operations:
EXCLUDE_INSTRUCTOR_REPOS=true

# This filters out repositories with "instructor" in the name:
# ‚úÖ Included: cs6600-homework1-student123
# ‚ùå Excluded: cs6600-homework1-instructor-tests
```

### File Type Support
```bash
# Universal file type examples:
ASSIGNMENT_FILE="homework.py"        # Python
ASSIGNMENT_FILE="assignment.cpp"     # C++
ASSIGNMENT_FILE="queries.sql"        # SQL
ASSIGNMENT_FILE="notebook.ipynb"     # Jupyter

# Legacy support (still works):
ASSIGNMENT_NOTEBOOK="notebook.ipynb"  # Will be converted to ASSIGNMENT_FILE
```
